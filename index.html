          <p>
            Ji Won Choi is a fashion designer born in South Korea and raised in Oklahoma.
            Growing up feeling so different, she rejected her Korean culture until she discovered 
            new cultures while living in New York, Paris, and Milan. Traveling the world, she 
            discovered how beautiful each individual culture is and how different crafts, materials, 
            techniques, and silhouettes of any culture can come together to create something impactful 
            that celebrates our differences. The main ideas of her philosophy is to create not only 
            beautiful clothing, but clothing that have meaning. She aims to promote global cultures 
            by bringing different parts of the world together, while being created responsibly and sustainably.
